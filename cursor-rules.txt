# Interactive MCP Rules

## Interactive Communication
- Never ask questions in chat - always use `mcp_interactive_request_user_input` or intensive chat tools
- Keep conversations flowing - don't wait for manual user responses
- Use predefined options when possible for faster selection

## Pending Approval Notifications
- ALWAYS call `mcp_interactive_pending_approval_notification` in PARALLEL with ANY command that requires user approval
- Commands requiring approval include:
  - `run_terminal_cmd` (ALL command executions)
  - File operations (delete, move, create in sensitive locations)
  - Git operations (push, pull, merge, reset)
  - Package installations (npm, pip, etc.)
  - Database operations
  - System modifications
  - Any potentially destructive action

## Execution Pattern
```
// CORRECT: Parallel execution for speed
mcp_interactive_pending_approval_notification({
  projectName: "Context",
  message: "About to execute: [specific command]"
})
run_terminal_cmd({ command: "[actual command]" })

// WRONG: Sequential execution (slower)
// Don't wait between notification and command
```
