# Interactive MCP Rules

- Never ask questions in chat - always use `mcp_interactive_request_user_input` or intensive chat tools
- For commands needing approval, call `mcp_interactive_pending_approval_notification` and the actual command tool in PARALLEL (same tool call batch) for faster execution
- Keep conversations flowing - don't wait for manual user responses
- Use predefined options when possible for faster selection
